      <h2>About Fahri AKBABA</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Front-end Developer. I create successful websites that are fast,
        easy to use, and built with best practices. My main experience is in
        front-end development but I also have a passion for design.
      </p>
      <p>
        My clients have found that hiring me has saved them time and money, made
        it easier to grow their website alongside their business, and made for a
        product that is consistently of high quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use HTML, CSS,,Saas, Bootstrap, JavaScript and React to produce
        responsive websites and web apps that provide users the best and most
        appropriate experience suited to their device and browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write standards based code that is semantic, accessible, search-engine
        friendly, easy to maintain, cross browser compatible, and performant.
